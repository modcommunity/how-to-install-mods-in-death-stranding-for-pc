A guide on how to **install mods** in **Death Stranding** on PC. This guide will use trusted sources such as [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/). Unfortunately, as far as we're aware, there are no supported mod managers like [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) for Death Stranding.

This guide is written for **Windows users**. However, some steps can be adapted for Linux users running the game through Proton or [Lutris](https://lutris.net/).

While Death Stranding is not as heavily modded as other AAA titles, there are still a growing number of mods available to enhance visuals, UI, models, and gameplay tweaks.

## Requirements
* Death Stranding installed via Steam or Epic Games
* A free [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/) account (optional, but recommended)
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or another archive utility
* A basic understanding of navigating and copying files in Windows

## Game Version Notes
Here are some notes regarding the game version.

### Steam
* Most commonly used for modding.

### Epic Games
* Works with mods.
* Some mods may not support this version due to differing file structures.

## Backup Your Game Files!
Before installing any mods, it's recommended to **back up** your game directory and save files.

To backup your game files, you may perform the following steps.

* Navigate to your Death Stranding install directory on your PC.
    * Steam: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Death Stranding`
    * Epic: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\DeathStranding`
* Copy the entire folder to another safe location (e.g. your desktop).
* Back up your saves, located in the following folder.
    * `C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\KojimaProductions\DeathStranding`

This ensures you can roll back in case a mod causes your game to crash or corrupts your installation.

## Where To Download Mods
The most popular website that provides Death Standing mods is [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/deathstranding). 

Other modding communities or forums may host mods, but be cautious and always scan files for malware.

**NOTE** - Always read the mod description and posts for installation instructions, compatibility info, and dependencies.

## Manual Mod Installation
As of right now, manually installing mods is the only method available. Each mod may have different instructions, but generally I've found the following steps the most common for installing mods.

1. Download the mod manually from Nexus Mods.
2. Use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the archive.
3. Follow the instructions in the mod's `readme`.
4. Most mods will involve replacing or adding files to the following locations:
    * `Death Stranding\data`
    * Or creating a `mods` folder if instructed
5. Launch the game and verify changes.

**WARNING** - Some mods overwrite game files. Always back up original files before replacing them!

## Launch Death Stranding & Test
After installing the mods, launch Death Stranding and test them. They should be activated automatically.

## Modding Limitations
Unfortunately, Death Stranding modding is **somewhat limited** compared to games like Skyrim or Fallout.

Here's what to expect:

* No official mod support or scripting tools.
* No modded load order or plugin system.
* Most mods are cosmetic or simple tweaks (textures, models, reshades).
* File integrity checks may revert changes when updates are pushed.

That said, the community is slowly growing, and better modding tools will hopefully emerge over time!

## Conclusion
By now, you should have a basic understanding on how to download, install, and configure mods in Death Standing.

Additionally, keep the following in mind.

* Safely back up your Death Stranding install and saves
* Understand the limitations of the current modding scene
