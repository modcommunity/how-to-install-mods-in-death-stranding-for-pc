## Requirements
* Death Stranding installed via Steam or Epic Games Store
* A free [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/deathstranding) account
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or another archive utility
* [Vortex Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) (Optional)
* Basic understanding of navigating and copying files in Windows

## Game Version Notes
Here are some notes regarding the game version.

### Steam
* Most commonly used for modding.
* Vortex can auto-detect the install path.

### Epic Games
* Works with mods, but Vortex may require manual setup.
* Some mods may not support this version due to differing file structures.

## Backup Your Game Files!
Before installing any mods, it's recommended to **back up** your game directory and save files.

To backup your game files, you may perform the following steps.

* Navigate to your Death Stranding install directory on your PC.
    * Steam: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Death Stranding`
    * Epic: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\DeathStranding`
* Copy the entire folder to another safe location (e.g. your desktop).
* Back up your saves, located in the following folder.
    * `C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\KojimaProductions\DeathStranding`

This ensures you can roll back in case a mod causes your game to crash or corrupts your installation.

## Installing Vortex Mod Manager
[Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) is the easiest way to manage mods for Death Stranding.

To install and configure Vortex, please perform the following steps.

1. Download Vortex from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files).
2. Run the installer and launch Vortex.
3. It should detect Death Stranding automatically. If not:
    1. Click **Games**, search for *Death Stranding*, and click **Manage**.
    2. Manually point it to the game's executable if needed.

## Where To Download Mods
The most popular website that provides Death Standing mods is [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/deathstranding). 

Other modding communities or forums may host mods, but be cautious and always scan files for malware.

**NOTE** - Always read the mod description and posts for installation instructions, compatibility info, and dependencies.

## Installing Mods Through Vortex
To install mods through Vortex, follow these steps.

1. Log in to your Nexus Mods account in your browser.
2. Visit a mod page and click **Mod Manager Download**.
3. The mod file should open in Vortex.
4. In Vortex:
    * Go to the **Mods** tab.
    * Enable the mod.
    * Click **Deploy Mods** if prompted.

## Manual Mod Installation (Advanced)
Some users may prefer manually installing mods or a mod may require a manual installation itself. In either case, you can perform the following steps to manually install a mod.

1. Download the mod manually from Nexus Mods.
2. Use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the archive.
3. Follow the instructions in the mod's `readme`.
4. Most mods will involve replacing or adding files to the following locations:
    * `Death Stranding\data`
    * Or creating a `mods` folder if instructed
5. Launch the game and verify changes.

**WARNING** - Some mods overwrite game files. Always back up original files before replacing them!

## Launch Death Stranding & Test
After installing the mods, launch Death Stranding and test them. They should be activated automatically.

## Modding Limitations
Unfortunately, Death Stranding modding is **somewhat limited** compared to games like Skyrim or Fallout.

Here's what to expect:

* No official mod support or scripting tools.
* No modded load order or plugin system.
* Most mods are cosmetic or simple tweaks (textures, models, reshades).
* File integrity checks may revert changes when updates are pushed.

That said, the community is slowly growing, and better modding tools will hopefully emerge over time!

## Conclusion
By now, you should have a basic understanding on how to download, install, and configure mods in Death Standing.

Additionally, keep the following in mind.

* Safely back up your Death Stranding install and saves
* Use Vortex to manage mods
* Manually install mods if needed
* Understand the limitations of the current modding scene
